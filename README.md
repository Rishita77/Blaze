# Welcome to Blaze!

We are having issue deploying as we have handlebars(.hbs) instead of .html that we learned for (and during the hackathon) so you are requested to run it locally using the following steps:

## Step 1: Clone the GitHub Repository

Clone the Blaze GitHub repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rishita77/Blaze.git
```

## Step 2: Navigate to the Mernbackend Directory

Open your terminal and navigate to the `mernbackend` directory of the cloned repository using the following command:

```bash
cd mernbackend
```

## Step 3: Run the Application Locally

Run the following command in your terminal to start the application locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Accessing the Application

Once the application is running locally, you can access it in your browser using the following URLs:

- **Index Page:** [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **About Page:** [localhost:3000/about](http://localhost:3000/about)
- **Collab Page:** [localhost:3000/collab](http://localhost:3000/collab)
- **Colleges Page:** [localhost:3000/colleges](http://localhost:3000/colleges)

You can replace the names of the files mentioned with their corresponding URLs to access different pages of the application.

If you don't have MongoDB installed, you can access the pages by typing their URLs directly into the browser address bar.
